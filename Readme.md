# CWP Gumby Theme
_(Note: Still in active development)_
This is intended to be a straight substitution of bootstrap for gumby (http://gumbyframework.com/), using up to date coding standards. CWP base templates are being updated to use the gumby scss framework, and scss is being written to fill in the gaps for all CWP features. Accessibility is being taken into account, but otherwise, the theme uses the gumby defaults with minor tweaking to fit into the cwp template environment.
